This repository contains a live Bitcoin trading dashboard built with Panel that brings together real time price tracking, rule based trading strategies, performance monitoring, and notifications in one place. The app pulls BTC prices from multiple exchanges with automatic fallbacks, runs a configurable Dollar Cost Averaging strategy based on price drops, and supports an ATR based trade with a dynamic stop loss. All portfolio balances, trades, and profit and loss are calculated directly in Python using a shared, thread safe state, with background workers handling price updates, DCA checks, and stop loss conditions. Users can adjust budgets, DCA thresholds, and ATR parameters from the interface, manually open or close trades, and receive optional Telegram alerts when key events occur. Alongside the core trading logic, an embedded LLM advisor reviews the already computed metrics such as ROI and PnL and summarizes which strategy is performing better. The model is intentionally limited to an advisory role through an in code prompt, so it cannot place trades or change parameters, keeping decisions transparent, explainable, and fully under user control.
